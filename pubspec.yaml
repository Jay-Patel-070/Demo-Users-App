  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Roboto
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto_Condensed-Regular.ttf
     - family: Robotomedium
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto_Condensed-Medium.ttf
           weight: 500
     - family: Robotobold
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto_Condensed-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
     - family: Robotobolditalic
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto_Condensed-BoldItalic.ttf
           weight: 700
     - family: Robotomediumitalic
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto_Condensed-MediumItalic.ttf
           weight: 500
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
